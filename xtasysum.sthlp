{cmd:xtasysum} {varlist} {ifin} [{cmd:,} {cmd:Threshold(}{it:#}{cmd:)} {cmd:Frequency} {cmd:Sum} {cmd:fdm} {cmd:GRSum} {cmd:GRFre} {cmd:grssave(}{it:string}{cmd:)} {cmd:grfsave(}{it:string}{cmd:)} {cmd:csd} {cmd:CSDOpt(}{it:string asis}{cmd:)} {cmd:cips(}{it:numlist integer min=2 max=2}{cmd:)} {cmd:CIPSOpt(}{it:string asis}{cmd:)} {cmd:NOgen}]


{title:Description}

{p 4 4 4}{cmd:xtasysum} generates and summarizes partial sums for modeling asymmetry with panel data. If no options are specified then positive and negative partial sums around a threshold of zero are created. 
The two new variables appear as {it:var}_p and {it:var}_n, respectively. The variables can then be used to model and test for asymmetry using regression analysis. The user may also generate frequencies and summary statistics, test for cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity, and 
generate graphs of the frequencies and partial sums. 


{title:Options}

{phang}{opt Threshold(#)} specifies the threshold by which the partial sums are generated; default is {cmd:Threshold(0)}. 

{phang}{opt Frequency} creates a table containing the frequencies of the partial sums by each variable in {varlist}.

{phang}{opt Sum} creates a summary table of the partial sums for each variable in {varlist}; see {help xtsum}.

{phang}{opt fdm} generates a variable of the partial sums based on the first difference method (see Allison (2019) and York and Light (2017)). 

{phang}{opt GRSum} generates a line graph of the partial sums by panel. No graph is drawn, but a graph for each variable is saved. 

{phang}{opt GRFre} generates a bar graph of the frequencies of the partial sums by panel. No graph is drawn, but a graph for each variable is saved. 

{phang}{opt grssave(string)} saves the line graph of the partial sums by panel with a specified name. 

{phang}{opt grfsave(string)} saves the bar graph of the partial sums by panel with a specified name. 

{phang}{opt csd} reports the Pesaran (2015) test for weak cross-sectional dependence and the exponent of cross-sectional dependence (Bailey, Kapetanios, and Pesaran 2016, 2019). This is a wrapper of Ditzen's (2021) {stata xtcse2} program.

{phang}{opt CSDOpt(string asis)} passes options to {stata xtcse2}.

{phang}{opt cips(numlist integer min=2 max=2)} reports the Pesaran (2007) panel unit-root test in the presence of cross-sectional dependence. This is a wrapper of the {stata xtcips} program (Burdisso and Sangiácomo 2016). The first integer refers to the maximum number of lags included in the test, and the second integer is the autocorrelation order used in the Lagrange multiplier test (see {help xtcips}).

{phang}{opt CIPSOpt(string asis)} passes options to {stata xtcips}.

{phang}{opt NOgen} does not create partial sums for the variable. This option cannot be combined with {opt threshold}. 



{title:Examples}

{p 4 4}The following examples are based on an {browse "https://github.com/rthombs/xtasysum/blob/example.dta":example dataset} consisting of annual country-level data for GDP per capita, the percentage of the population residing in urban areas, and total population from 1971 to 2015. 

{p 4}To generate the partial sums:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp} 

{p 4}The default threshold is 0, which can be changed with the {opt Threshold} option:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp, threshold(.01)} 

{p 4 4}To generate the frequencies and descriptive statistics of the partial sums by each variable:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp, frequency sum} 

{p 4 4}To test for cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp, csd cips(3 3)} 

{p 4}To generate a graph of the frequencies and partial sums:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp, grfre grsum} 

{p 4}To generate variables using the first difference method:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp, fdm} 

{p 4}If the partial sums are already defined:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp_p lngdp_n, nogen csd} 

{p 4}The options that can be abbreviated:

{p 8}{stata xtasysum lngdp, t f s grs grf}
